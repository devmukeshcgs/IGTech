                            On his passion for hospitality</h4>
                        <p class="para-body">My affair with hospitality began in culinary arts - over the years, with evolving job expectations
                            and requirements, and my thirst for upgradation, I have moved to different verticals of the industry,
                            enjoying and experiencing every challenge and every opportunity the industry offered me.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para-body"> I believe that hospitality, in its broader connotation, encompasses all elements of customer service
                            and satisfaction, regardless of the industry or one’s role in the organization. There is a core
                            group of qualities that remains sought after in a professional- namely integrity, reliability
                            and passion. For all the long hours and challenging guest encounters, it is singularly passion
                            that stands out and stays by the side of any hospitality professional.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para-body"> Hospitality not only allowed me to drive myself, but to move ahead as a supervisor and manager to
                            lead my team in delivering an enhanced guest experience. It also pushed me to upgrade my skills,
                            transforming me into a lifelong learner and helped me evolve into the role I assume today.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para-body"> ISH is all about relevance, lifelong learning and research – this education platform is being built
                            and brought across to you, the students, by people who are still making waves in the industry.
                            That’s how much we believe in real time learning. You are under the guidance and tutelage of
                            a team that is passionate about what they do and represent.
                        </p>
                        <p class="para-body">Our philosophy is simple; we want you to become the best at what you do. It remains my personal goal
                            to ensure that every one of you truly engage with all aspects of hospitality through your academic
                            journey at ISH, well beyond the classroom where you will develop meaningful life-long connects.
